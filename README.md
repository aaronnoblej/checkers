# Checkers Project
 This is an experimental checkers game that I started making the after my sophomore year of college. It currently includes a GUI and an AI that users can play against. This project helped me learn the advanced features and capabilities of Java.
 
The game currently allows for three modes: human vs. human, human vs. AI, and AI vs. AI.

This project was built entirely in Netbeans so this repository contains all generated files from the Netbeans IDE.
